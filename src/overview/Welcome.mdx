### Equity UI is an Open Source Design system project built by a team of mentors and volunteers.

Back in the <strong>Open Sprints 2024 hackathon</strong>, our fellows and mentors built the very first four components of our design system. Curious about how it all started? Dive into the early [<u>docs</u>](https://www.opensprints.tech/docs/projects/beagle/) here and donâ€™t miss the first [<u>design tokens session</u>](https://youtu.be/4tzLSMSYkag?si=P7Gxzyvf-tVR9WdK&t=29) presented by our awesome designer <strong>Priyanka Thomas</strong>.

Fast forward to the end of <strong>2025</strong> â€” a new team came together and grew the library to <strong>10 designed and coded components</strong> ðŸŽ‰. Huge shoutout to the <strong>Prima DS team</strong> and our mentors at <strong>Aroris Health</strong> who helped make it happen!
