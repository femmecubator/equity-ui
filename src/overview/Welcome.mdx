Hey there!

### <u>Project Overview</u>

### Equity UI is an Open Source Design system project built by a team of mentors and volunteers.

Open Sprint 2024 hackathon fellows and mentors built the first 4 components posted on Storybook. You can find more docs on how this got started in the early days here: [https://www.opensprints.tech/docs/projects/beagle/](https://www.opensprints.tech/docs/projects/beagle/) and a recorded [design tokens session](https://youtu.be/4tzLSMSYkag?si=P7Gxzyvf-tVR9WdK&t=29) by designer Priyanka Thomas here.

By the end of 2025, a second team completed the open source design system library to contain 10 designed and coded components. The library was produced in collaboration with the Prima DS team and mentors at Aroris Health.

### <u>Get Involved!</u>

Femmecubatorâ€™s end goal is to use this open source library to teach aspiring designers and developers, and conduct workshops for those interested in learning how to build a design system.
