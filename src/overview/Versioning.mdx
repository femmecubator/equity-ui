# Version Status

Your component library will evolve over time. Right now, you might still be in <strong>pre-release (v0)</strong> or planning your <strong>first release (Acme Company DS v1)</strong> with only the first 10 components. Either way, versioning is crucial for tracking changes as both design and development teams contribute over the long term.

### Semantic Versioning

All updates should follow [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) so changes can be tracked and communicated consistently.

Design-driven changes usually fall into two categories:

1. <strong>Token-level changes</strong> – Adjustments to design tokens such as colors
   or typography.
2. <strong>Component-level changes</strong> – Structural updates or new variants
   to components.

### Minor Version (Token Remapping)

Example: Design requests a new color for the disabled button.

- This requires updating the token mapping in code.
- Considered a <strong>minor version bump</strong>.

### Major Version (Component Redesign)

Example: Adding an icon inside a form field.

- This requires restructuring the component code.
- Considered a <strong>major version bump</strong>.
- Note: There’s no automated Figma-to-code sync—developers must align new Figma designs with Storybook manually.

### Token Guidelines

- Your JSON tokens are already available in code, so no dev time is needed when re-mapping the component’s color, text or radius tokens.
- Only create new token names when absolutely necessary. The existing token set is designed to cover most cases.
- <u>
    <strong>
      When a new token name is added on Figma, that triggers the ZH to Gitlab
      workflow.
    </strong>
  </u>

Note: Zeroheight is your Token Management space that connects new updates from Figma Variable API to Code (Gitlab).
